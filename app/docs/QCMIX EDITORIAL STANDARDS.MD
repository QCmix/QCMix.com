# QCMIX EDITORIAL STANDARDS — CORE PRINCIPLES

Purpose:
QCMix exists to document nightlife, bartending, and music culture as it is lived — not as it is marketed.

Editorial North Star:
Truth over hype.
People over brands.
Community over clout.

This platform documents working culture. It does not promote it.

All editorial decisions must prioritize:
- Authentic voice
- Peer respect
- Long-term cultural value
