# QCmix Rules & Editorial Charter

## Status
LOCKED — v1  
This document defines what QCmix is, how it operates, and what is permitted.
Any change to these rules requires explicit review.

---

## 1. What QCmix Is

QCmix is an independent editorial publication documenting nightlife culture in the Quad Cities, with a focus on:

- Bars (as cultural spaces)
- Bartenders (as cultural operators)
- Musicians (as live performers in context)

QCmix exists to provide context, continuity, and credibility — not promotion.

---

## 2. What QCmix Is Not

QCmix is not:
- A directory
- A submission platform
- A social network
- A booking tool
- A review site
- A promotional outlet
- A hospitality blog
- A “best of” list engine

Any feature that moves QCmix toward these outcomes is out of scope.

---

## 3. Editorial Authority

All content on QCmix is:
- Selected by QCmix
- Written by QCmix
- Framed by QCmix
- Published at QCmix’s discretion

There are:
- No self-submissions
- No “claim this” mechanics
- No user accounts (v1)
- No guest posts (v1)

Participation is by inclusion, not access.

---

## 4. Core Editorial Law

**QCmix publishes context, not promotion.**

If content exists primarily to:
- advertise
- self-promote
- increase visibility
- generate hype
- drive action

…it does not qualify as QCmix content.

---

## 6. Language & Tone

Tone must be:
- Observational
- Calm
- Measured
- Analytical
- Confident without enthusiasm

**Prohibited Language**
- “Don’t miss”
- “Hottest”
- “Best in the QC”
- “Must-see”
- “Legendary” (unless historically verified)
- Emojis
- Excessive adjectives

If it sounds excited, rewrite colder.

---

## 7. Images & Media

Images must:
- Be candid or environmental
- Reflect night or interior lighting
- Avoid studio polish
- Avoid logo-forward composition
- Avoid flyers as primary visuals

Images support the story. They never sell the story.

---

## 8. Volume & Frequency

QCmix is low-volume by design.
- No posting quotas
- No filler
- No SEO padding
- No trend chasing

One strong piece outweighs many weak ones.

---

## 9. Monetization Principle

**Money may change placement, never language.**

Paid content:
- Follows identical editorial rules
- Never alters tone
- Is disclosed quietly as “Paid placement”
- Never leads the site or section

Editorial authority is never sold.

---

## 10. Change Control

The following require explicit review:
- Allowing submissions
- Adding accounts
- Introducing utilities (menus, recipes, tools)
- Adding rankings or lists
- Increasing output volume
- Shifting tone toward promotion

If a change weakens authority, it is rejected.

---

## 11. Guiding Question

When in doubt:
> “Does this help someone understand the Quad Cities scene better —  
> or does it help someone promote themselves?”

Only the first belongs on QCmix.
